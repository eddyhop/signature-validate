## [Ai-Blockchain](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aiblockchain/)
Ai-BlockChain is a private, closely held technology company that has developed a payment cloud blockchain platform. Our technology utilizes AI agents, known as Super Peers, to create and maintain the distributed ledger, instead of the classic blockchain contract consensus secured by expensive, dedicated mining hardware.

In our organization, we currently possess a sufficient number of web developers, designers, and AI developers. However, we have identified a shortage of blockchain developers, which is hindering our progress in that particular field.

## Objective
The primary goal is to assist us in selecting a highly skilled blockchain developer who possesses extensive expertise in web3 and smart contract development.

## Step
- Download this project to your local machine.
- Create a new branch based on your name.
- Run the project and troubleshoot any bugs that arise.
- Add an endpoint for the sign process using MetaMask.
- Push your updated project to your git repo and share URL.

## Environment
- OS: Windows 10, 11
- Node: >18.13.0

## Node.js & Express server template
The server is just a template within Node.js, Express and Mongoose.


### Requirement 
Develop an endpoint that facilitates the signing process using Metamask, ensuring the verification of transactions made by the Metamask wallet and the accompanying subtext.
The object included in the client's request is as follows.

```bash
  {
    "transaction": "0x.....",
    "walletAddress": "0x.....",
    "text": "Hello, Metamask"
  }
```

Then, it is needed to store wallet address in MongoDB if it is valid

## Timeframe
This test should be completed within three hours from the date you begin the assessment.
